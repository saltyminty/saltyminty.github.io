[EECS 106A (*Introduction to Robotics*)](https://ucb-ee106.github.io/eecs106a-fa23site/) is Berkeley EECS's first introductory undergraduate course teaching students robotics – kinematics, dynamics, control of robot manipulators, robotic vision, and sensing.

Aside from standard staff duties of running sections, office hours, proctoring, writing exams, and mentoring/grading final projects (there's not much interesting content to talk about there anyway), below are some of the long-term content/logistics aspects of the course I've worked on:
- migrated the improved 16B lab autograder system over to 106A labs
- made a variety of updates to [Lab 1](https://ucb-ee106.github.io/eecs106a-fa23site/assets/labs/lab1.pdf), [Lab 3](https://ucb-ee106.github.io/eecs106a-fa23site/assets/labs/lab3.pdf), and [Lab 5](https://ucb-ee106.github.io/eecs106a-fa23site/assets/labs/lab5.pdf). The average duration students took to finish these labs greatly decreased, showing an improvement in lab quality
- wrote a new [Lab 7](https://ucb-ee106.github.io/eecs106a-fa23site/assets/labs/lab7.pdf) to focus on fullstack robotics with the Sawyer, using the cameras on the Sawyer to locate positions and execute custom trajectories. This lab ended up forming the basis for many students’ final projects, showing its importance in the lab curriculum

We made our entire Midterm 1 banana themed and then handed out bananas to all students at the exam.
