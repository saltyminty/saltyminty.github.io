*Why are you a duck?*

Every programmer knows the tale of [the rubber duck](https://rubberduckdebugging.com). I followed the duck part, but forgot about the rubber part. Not sure about the debugging part, but the duck comes to all my exams and I haven't flunked yet, so I think its working.

I had it as my profile picture when college first started and everything was online, so it's what many people recognize me by now. Also because I have no pictures of myself. The curse of being a photographer â€“ you only have good pictures of other people.

This website was primarily made to host some of my [projects](/projects/) that couldn't quite make it onto my resume.

Outside of school, I enjoy skiing (I swear by [K2](https://k2snow.com)), volleyball (libero because I'm too ~~short~~ vertically challenged to play anything else), and [martial arts](https://www.instagram.com/reel/CkaPu1TpxcU/?igshid=NTYzOWQzNmJjMA==) (wushu, the art of hitting yourself as loudly as possible). I also do photography, [you can check out some of my work on this site](/photography/)

I once guessed randomly on a [CS 188 midterm](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs188/fa22/assets/exam/cs188-fa22-midterm.pdf) and got a 46%.
